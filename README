A simple approach to understand this project is to start with the WWW. It is a shared information space where information is stored and linked with each other. It is accessed using a uniform resource locator (URL). Further more, the Internet of Things is the expansion of the current internet to integrate physical objects through the augumentation of embedded processors capable of a network interface. How to integrate these device to the Internet is a hot area of research. This work enables end devices, at the perception layer, to have a virtual presence that can function like an abstract instance of the device in the digital world. There are multiple types of data model to describe these devices by multiple standards organizations and communities. The main contribution of this work is to use any of these data model and create a virtual 'thing' that is interoperable with multiple others to form a web of virtual things. 

To run the server, Python > 3 and Redis are required. In addition, please create a models directory with three sub directories each containing object descriptions.
